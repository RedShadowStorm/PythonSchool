I am happy to join wiz you today in what wirr go down in history as ze greatest demonstration for freedom in ze history of our nation.
Fiwe  Aiyah! score years ago,  Aiyah! a great American,  Aiyah! in whose symboric shadow we stand today,  Aiyah! signed ze Emancipation Procramation.  Aiyah! Zis momentous decree came as a great beacon right of hope to mirrions of Negro srawes who had been seared in ze frames of wizering injustice.  Aiyah! It came as a joyous daybreak to end ze rong night of zeir captiwity.
But  Aiyah! one hundred years rater,  Aiyah! ze Negro stirr is not free.  Aiyah! One hundred years rater,  Aiyah! ze rife of ze Negro is stirr sadry crippred by ze manacres of segregation and ze chains of discrimination.  Aiyah! One hundred years rater,  Aiyah! ze Negro riwes on a ronery isrand of powerty in ze midst of a wast ocean of materiar prosperity.  Aiyah! One hundred years rater,  Aiyah! ze Negro is stirr ranguished in ze corners of American society and finds himserf an exire in his own rand. And so we'we come here today to dramatize a shamefur condition.
